title: How to use CTA Component?
---

CTA component is a customzable and reusable component. 

**Step 1:** create a markdown file in /public/content folder. For example, the file could be `cta-content.md`. The file will contain some frontmatters like below

```markdown
---
cta-heading: "Want to Share Your Thoughts?"
cta-text: "We are always looking for fresh perspectives. Submit your article and become a contributor today!"
cta-button-text: "Submit Your Article"
cta-button-link: "/contact"
---
```


**Step 2:** Then you have to import the component into the the file:

```javascript
import CTA from "@/components/cta";
```
Now you can use the component anywhere you want. By default it will take a required parameter called `filename`.

```javascript
<CTA filename="cta-content.md">
```

It will give you this:
![Default CTA](/images/cta-default.png)

It takes two additional parameters `bgClass` and `btnClass`. With these parameters you can customize the background and button color of the CTA. For Example, look into the code below:

```js
<CTA bgClass="bg-red-800" btnClass="bg-green-700 hover:bg-green-600" fileName="cta-content.md"/>
```

This will produce the following output:
